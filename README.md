# coinwar-test: Run coin-war.py system tests
# Bart Massey 2021

The Python program `run-tests.py` here runs a `coin-war.py`
with the tests given in the `cwtests` directory. The program
can be configured flexibly: run with `--help` for usage.

During execution, `run-tests.py` will create a `.tests`
directory containing the "compiled" tests.
